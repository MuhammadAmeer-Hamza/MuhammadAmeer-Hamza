    <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the foundational language used to create and structure content 
    on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for web pages by defining elements such as headings,
    paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia content. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to 
    organize and format web content, making it essential for developing websites. As the backbone of web 
    pages, HTML ensures that content is displayed correctly in web browsers and is accessible to users. 
    Understanding HTML is crucial for anyone looking to create or edit web content, as it lays the 
    groundwork for more advanced web development practices.</p>

    <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a crucial technology in web development used to 
    style and layout web pages. It allows developers to control the visual appearance of websites, 
    including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enhances user experience by ensuring consistent
    design across pages and enabling responsive designs that adapt to different devices. By separating
    content from design, CSS makes it easier to maintain and update websites.</p>

    <img src="Assets/JAVASCRIPT.jpg" title="JAVASCRIPT" alt="Blank" height="400" width="700">
    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a versatile and widely-used programming language that powers the dynamic behavior of 
    websites. As a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables developers to 
    create interactive elements like animations, form validations, and content updates without reloading 
    the page. Its flexibility and ease of use have made it an essential tool for both beginners and 
    experienced developers. With a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and
    Vue.js, JavaScript continues to evolve, driving innovation in web development and beyond.</p>
