        <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a crucial technology in web development used to 
        style and layout web pages. It allows developers to control the visual appearance of websites, 
        including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enhances user experience by ensuring consistent
        design across pages and enabling responsive designs that adapt to different devices. By separating
        content from design, CSS makes it easier to maintain and update websites.</p>

    <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements on a web page should be displayed in terms of layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. Here are some key points about CSS:

        Separation of Content and Presentation: CSS allows web developers to separate the content of a web page (HTML) from its visual presentation (CSS). This separation improves maintainability and flexibility.
        
        Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements. For example, you can use a selector to apply styles to all paragraphs or to a specific element with a unique ID.</p>

        <h2> THREE TYPES OF CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><I>INTERNAL</I></lI>
            <li><I>EXTERNAL</I></li>
            <lI><I>INLINE</I></lI>
        </ul>
            <H4><B>INTERNAL</B></H4>
            <p>Let’s start by talking about the Internal style. CSS styles done this way are loaded each time an entire website is refreshed, which may increase loading time. Additionally, <BR>you won’t be able to use the same CSS style on multiple pages as it’s contained within a single page. However, this also comes with benefits. </p>
                <H4><B>EXTERNAL</B></H4>
                <p>The External method might be the most convenient one. Everything is done externally on a .css file. <br> means you can do all the styling on a separate file and apply the CSS to any page you want. The External style might also improve loading times. 
                    <BR>

                  
                    <H4><B>INLINE</B></H4>
                    <p>Lastly, we will talk about the Inline style of CSS. Inline works with specific elements that have the style tag. Each component has to be stylized, it might not be the best or fastest way to handle CSS. But it can come in handy. For example, <BR>
                         if you want to change a single element, quickly preview changes, or maybe you doNT It have access to the CSS files. </p>

         <br>
           <P> Properties and Values: CSS rules consist of properties and values. Properties define aspects such as color, font size, margin, and padding, while values specify the settings for those properties. For example:
        
            css Cascading: The "cascading" part of CSS means that styles can fall back to more general rules if more specific rules are not available. allows multiple style sheets to influence the same document.
            
           <br> Responsive Design: CSS plays a crucial role in responsive web design, enabling web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Techniques such as media queries are used to apply different styles based on the device characteristics.
            
            Frameworks and Preprocessors:are CSS frameworks like Bootstrap that provide pre-designed components, and preprocessors like Sass and LESS that add functionality to CSS, such as variables and nesting, to make writing CSS more efficient.
            
            Here is a basic example of CSS applied to an HTML document:
